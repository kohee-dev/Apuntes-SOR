Oh my hero,
so far away now.
Will I ever see your smile?
Love goes away,
like night into day.
It's just a fading dream...
I'm the darkness,
you're the stars.
Our love is brighter than
the sun.
For eternity,
for me ther can be,
only you, my chosen one...
Must I forget you?
Our solemn promise
Will autumn take the place
of spring?
What shall I do?
I'm lost without you
Speak to me once more!
We must part now.
My life goes on.
But my heart won't give
you up.
Ere I walk away,
let me hear you say.
I meant as much to you...
So gently,
you touched my heart.
I will be forever yours.
Come what may,
I won't age a day,
I'll wait for you, always..
